    "# Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a classical algorithm, which a huge topic on its own and this is only a brief introduction. In programming, a recursive function is a function that calls itself as part of its execution. Recursion can be a useful technique for solving problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems, as it allows you to break down a large, complex problem into simpler pieces and solve each piece separately. Functions can be **recursive** which means that they can call themselve from inside themselve.\n",

    "## Binary Search \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is an algorithm that is used to search for a specific value in a **sorted list**. It works by dividing the list in half and comparing the value to the element at the midpoint of the list. If the value is greater than the element at the midpoint, the algorithm searches the right half of the list. If the value is less than the element at the midpoint, the algorithm searches the left half of the list. This process is repeated until the value is found or it is determined that the value is not in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for searching large lists because it reduces the search space by half at each step. This means that the worst-case time complexity of binary search is **O(log n)**, where n is the size of the list. This is much faster than a linear search, which has a worst-case time complexity of **O(n)**.\n",

    "This code defines a function called draw_triangle() that uses a recursive algorithm to draw a Sierpinski triangle using a PIL drawing object, a list of points representing the vertices of the triangle, and a recursion level. The function works by defining a base case and a recursive case: the base case simply draws a triangle using the given points, and the recursive case calculates the midpoints of the sides of the triangle and then recursively calls itself to draw three smaller triangles using these midpoints as the vertices."
