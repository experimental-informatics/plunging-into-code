    "# Markov Chain - Markovify Library \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the usage of a simple established library\n",
    "https://github.com/jsvine/markovify\n",
    "\n",
    "Markovify works best with large, well-punctuated texts. If your text does not use `.`s to delineate sentences, put each sentence on a newline, and use the `markovify.NewlineText` class instead of `markovify.Text` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So the parameters to control the result are well described there:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `state_size`\n",
    "by changing the state_size, it's possible to train in different orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `markovify.Text` uses a state size of 2. But you can instantiate a model with a different state size. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `tries`\n",
    "By default, the `make_sentence` method tries a maximum of 10 times per invocation, to make a sentence that does not overlap too much with the original text. If it is successful, the method returns the sentence as a string. If not, it returns `None`. To increase or decrease the number of attempts, use the `tries` keyword argument, e.g., call `.make_sentence(tries=100)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `max_overlap_ratio` / `max_overlap_total`\n",
    "By default, `markovify.Text` tries to generate sentences that do not simply regurgitate chunks of the original text. The default rule is to suppress any generated sentences that exactly overlaps the original text by 15 words or 70% of the sentence's word count. You can change this rule by passing `max_overlap_ratio` and/or `max_overlap_total` to the `make_sentence` method. Alternatively, this check can be disabled entirely by passing `test_output` as False."
